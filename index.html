                <p>As of 2013, roughly 85% of all Bachelor Degrees of Computer Science are awarded to men and roughly 60% are awarded to caucasians. This bottleneck drastically affects the representation of women and people of color that will head into Information Security.</p>
                <p>This has been our first year of operation and organization. We've hosted several conversations known as DefCon Unlocked with some of the attendees and organizers of DefCon to address concerns related to diversity in security.</p>
