    <h4>DEFCONcierge</h4>
    <p>Every year a welcome wagon for diversity in information security should occur at DEFCON, the largest InfoSec conference in the US. DEFCONcierge is a table near registration hosted by ISUnlocked in which we will be helping new con goers learn about all of the various events of the CON.</p>
    <p>Leaders from villages and other organizations will frequently visit the DEFCONierge table to gather people to bring to their respective areas, this not only helps increase foot traffic at events but also provides a way for new people to get acclimated to the convention.

    <h4>Conference Best Practices</h4>
    <p>Create a PDF for the website that includes a top 10 list of things to include at a conference to be inclusive, DOs and DONâ€™Ts for conferences, and general testimonials. Discussing with different diversity groups (women in tech, queercon, etc) what types of things they think would make for a better convention for them, and then using that information to better inform this document on the various groups and their needs.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <h4>Community Forum</h4>
    <p>Determine how we can best enable the community to discuss important issues in InfoSec, especially as it relates to conferences. Move forward with this plan.</p>
    <p>Identify what knowledge we need to obtain and what kind of space we can provide for to join and participate in conversations.  A place where people can post articles and start discussions. Something like a Facebook group so that those who participate notifications will be brought to their attention versus a space where they need to remember to visit us.</p>
    <p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/isunlocked/">reddit</a> page was created for ISUnlocked to fulfil the forum aspect of the milestone, however it still needs to be used and vetted for viability.</p>
